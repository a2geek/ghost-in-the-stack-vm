Capturing ideas
===============

Secondary model should handle array pointer arithmetic? This could make code generation simpler.
Validate memory footprint for variable allocation in some manner
Looks like usage of Symbol may need to be checked? There is no constraint that a found variable is what is expected (aka a constant instead of a variable).
Look at how bytecode is created - feels like Opcode and Directive can support Instruction more directly.
Need to figure out how to handle processor status register in CPU interactions; ProDOS functions use C. Probably only want get. (Otherwise state probably will get carried between calls accidentally.)
Review generated code and look for alternates with new opcodes.
Revisit the single line IF -- see what appears to be more standard.
Unit tests?  Integer BASIC(done)  BASIC(done)  optimizations(done)  code generation?
Interpreter for use in tests.
Structure assembly project; it's gonna get messier.
ProDOS commands (OPEN, READ, WRITE, CLOSE). Is this SUB and/or FUNCTION?
Add Applesoft
DEF FN == Function
Optimization - extract common code
