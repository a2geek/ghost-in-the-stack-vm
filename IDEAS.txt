Capturing ideas
===============

Strings. Constant strings can just point at end of program.
Unit tests?
Interpreter for use in tests.
Structure assembly project; it's gonna get messier.
WHILE loop
ProDOS commands (OPEN, READ, WRITE, CLOSE). Is this SUB and/or FUNCTION?
HGR
Bit shifting, bit anding, bit oring, bit xoring?
Arrays - need heap. Where? $200? but that is input and ProDOS can use it. If they are hard-coded, then they can just go into code!
Function libraries (with inline?) - can a function return more than one value?
Optimization - strength reduction (MOD 16 can be AND #$0F, MUL x2 can be shift left)
Optimization - extract common code
